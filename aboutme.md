Welcome my blog! My name is Wang Ma(马旺), I am interested in *Machine Learning*, *Computer Vision* and *Optimization*. I am now a visiting undergraduate at UC Irvine, while my home university is Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. You can learn more about me at [**my homepage**](https://wma17.github.io/).


I am now looking for a PHD position starting from 2024 Fall, feel free to contact me at *wma5{at}uci.edu* or *maw2020@mail.sustech.edu.cn* if you get interests in me! 


While the fascinating world of Deep Learning attracts me a lot, Rubik's cube, Baseball and Anime are also important parts in my life. I used to rank the 7th globally on SQ-1 cube(a special cube in Rubik's Cube family), and now I am still one of the top 10 palyers on this event in mainland China (March, 2023); meanwhile, I can solve a normal Rubik's Cube in about 9 seconds. I am willing to talk about Cube, Baseball and Anime with you, too!


Let me know if you have something to share with me!!
